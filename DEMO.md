## Expected Results

After completing this demo, you should have:

1. âœ… Imported a sample manuscript
2. âœ… Generated a comprehensive literary review
3. âœ… Viewed automatically tracked characters and plot events
4. âœ… Had interactive conversations with the AI editor
5. âœ… Exported a manuscript to DOCX format

## Common Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Grammar and Style Review

```
Chat: Review this paragraph for grammar and style:
"The key was laying on the ground. It's surface was covered with symbols that Sarah didn't understood."

Expected: Claude identifies:
- "laying" should be "lying"
- "It's" should be "Its"
- "didn't understood" should be "didn't understand"
```

### Scenario 2: Character Consistency

```
Chat: I mentioned the old man had a "walking stick" in Chapter 1 but later called it a "cane". Is this consistent?

Expected: Claude checks consistency and suggests:
- Pick one term and use it throughout
- Or explain why the terminology changed
```

### Scenario 3: Plot Development

```
Chat: I'm stuck on the cliffhanger at the end of Chapter 2. What are some ways I could resolve it in Chapter 3?

Expected: Claude provides multiple plot options while maintaining story consistency.
```

### Scenario 4: Prose Enhancement

```
Chat: This sentence feels flat: "Sarah was scared." Make it more vivid.

Expected: Claude suggests:
- "Sarah's heart hammered against her ribs."
- "Cold dread crept up Sarah's spine."
- "Sarah's breath caught in her throat."
```

## Tips for Demo Success

1. **Be Specific**: Ask focused questions for better results
2. **Iterate**: Build on previous responses
3. **Use Tools**: Ask Claude to track characters and events
4. **Save Work**: Export regularly to backup your progress
5. **Experiment**: Try different types of editing requests

## Performance Notes

- **First request**: May take 10-15 seconds (initializing)
- **Subsequent requests**: 5-10 seconds typically
- **Full reviews**: 2-5 minutes depending on manuscript length
- **Costs**: Approximately $0.10-0.30 for a full demo

## Troubleshooting Demo Issues

**Issue**: "No such file or directory: examples/sample_chapter.md"
**Solution**: Make sure you're in the `storybook` directory

**Issue**: Chat responses are very slow
**Solution**: Check your internet connection and API key

**Issue**: Import fails with "python-docx not found"
**Solution**: Install optional dependencies: `pip install python-docx pypdf`

**Issue**: Permission errors when editing
**Solution**: This is expected! Type 'y' to approve edits or 'n' to deny

## Next Steps After Demo

1. Try with your own manuscript
2. Explore different genres and styles
3. Experiment with custom editing requests
4. Set up automated workflows
5. Share feedback and suggestions
